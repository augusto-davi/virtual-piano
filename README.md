# :musical_keyboard: Virtual Piano

- This project was inspired by Wes Bos' [JavaScript 30](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) Drum Kit.
- I took the keyboard sound files from [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/24-piano-keys/).
- I want to improve the code and the UI.
- [Felipe Fialho's piano](https://piano.felipefialho.com/) is a good example.
